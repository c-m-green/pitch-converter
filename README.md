# pitch-converter

Ever wanted to encode a message in music and then decipher it? Want to store snarky messages in your songs? Feel like taking a random bunch of numbers and seeing what they sound like?

Here's a app I'm creating that will hopefully let you do such things!

<hr>

usage: `java -jar <app-name.jar> --mode=<encode|decode> <input-file> <output-file> <word-list>`

(word list only necessary when decoding)

Currently outputs music to `music.txt` and decoded strings to `matches.txt` in current directory.

Thanks are in order to https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for the large text file of words.
