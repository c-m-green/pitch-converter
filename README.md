Ever wanted to encode a message in music and then decipher it? Want to store snarky messages in your songs? Feel like taking a random bunch of numbers and seeing what they sound like?

Hey! That's cool, I guess!

Anyway, here's a app I'm creating that will hopefully let you do such things.

usage: `java -jar <jar-filename> --mode=<encode|decode> <input-file> <output-file>`

Currently outputs to `music.txt`

Thanks are in order to https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for the large text file of words.
